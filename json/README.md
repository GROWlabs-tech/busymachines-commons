# busymachines-commons-json

Current version is `0.2.0-M4`. SBT module id:
`"com.busymachines" %% "busymachines-commons-json" % "0.2.0-M4"`

## How it works
This module is a thin layer over [circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/), additionally, it depends on [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless). The latter being the mechanism through which `auto` and `semiauto` derivation can be made to work.

You can glean 99% of what's going on here by first understanding `circe`. This module provides just convenience, and a principled way of using it. The only "real" contribution of this is that provides a `Codec` type class, which is lacking from `circe`.

### Transitive dependencies
- circe 0.8.0 (with all its modules)
- shapeless 2.3.2
- cats 0.9.0

## Common usage

Most likely the best way to make use of the library is to have the following imports:
```scala
import busymachines.json._
import busymachines.json.syntax._
import busymachines.json.auto._
```

`json._` brings in common type definitions. `syntax._` handy syntactic ops to parse strings to `Json` and/or to decode them to a specified type—these are just syntactically convenient ways of doing what the objects in `utilsJson.scala` can do. By importing `auto._`, the compiler will try to automatically generate an `Encoder` or `Decoder` whenever one is required. So, when a method like `def decodeAs[A](json: String)(implicit decoder: Decoder[A])` is called the compiler will attempt to derive a `Decoder` for a type `A`.

## Decoding/encoding simple case class

### semiauto derivation
```scala
case class AnarchistMelon(
  noGods: Boolean,
  noMasters: Boolean,
  noSuperTypes: Boolean)

object CommonsJson extends App {

  import busymachines.json._
  import busymachines.json.semiauto._
  import busymachines.json.syntax._

  val anarchistMelon = AnarchistMelon(true, true, true)

  //we need an encoder, so using the functions from semiauto we can explicitly create it
  implicit val encoder: Encoder[AnarchistMelon] = deriveEncoder[AnarchistMelon]
  implicit val decoder: Decoder[AnarchistMelon] = deriveDecoder[AnarchistMelon]

  val jsonString: String = anarchistMelon.asJson.spaces2
  println(jsonString)
  println(jsonString.unsafeDecodeAs[AnarchistMelon])
}
```
Will print:
```json
{
  "noGods" : true,
  "noMasters" : true,
  "noSuperTypes" : true
}
```
```
AnarchistMelon(true,true,true)
```

### auto derivation
It's more or less the same, but with less boilerplate:
```scala
object CommonsJson extends App {

  import busymachines.json.auto._
  import busymachines.json.syntax._

  val anarchistMelon = AnarchistMelon(true, true, true)

  val jsonString: String = anarchistMelon.asJson.spaces2
  println(jsonString)
  println(jsonString.unsafeDecodeAs[AnarchistMelon])
}
```

### Codec
If you know you need both an `Encoder` and `Decoder` then you can just use `Codec` which is both of those things. So in the semiauto case we can simplify the code more by deriving only:
```scala
implicit val codec: Codec[AnarchistMelon] = deriveCodec[AnarchistMelon]
```

## Dealing with hierarchies

Unlike the `AnarchistMelon` in our previous example, regular melons accept hierarchy. And, like in real life, we have many hierarchies in code. But `circe` helps to wrangle them in—for dealing with real life hierarchies you should google Murray Bookchin.

Take the following hierarchy:  

```scala
sealed trait Melon { def weight: Int}
case class WinterMelon(fuzzy: Boolean, weight: Int) extends Melon
case class WaterMelon(seeds: Boolean, weight: Int) extends Melon
case object SmallMelon extends Melon { override val weight: Int = 0 }

sealed trait Taste
case object SweetTaste extends Taste
case object SourTaste extends Taste

sealed trait TastyMelon extends Melon { def tastes: Seq[Taste]}
case class SquareMelon(weight: Int, tastes: Seq[Taste]) extends TastyMelon
```
As you can see we have two parallel hierarchies. `Melon`, and `Taste` (this one being a vanilla way of doing "enumerations"). And a sub-hierarchy `TastyMelon`.
Now, as per good practice we'll put the Codecs separately from our application code.

### semiauto derivation of hierarchies

```scala
object melonsDefaultSemiAutoCodecs {
  import busymachines.json._
  import busymachines.json.semiauto._

  //this is a special method that encodes/decodes sealed trait hierarchies
  //composed of case objects only as plain strings, as opposed to the derivedCodec
  implicit val tasteEncoder: Codec[Taste] = deriveEnumerationCodec[Taste]
  implicit val melonEncoder: Codec[Melon] = deriveCodec[Melon]
}
```

Variants of an abstract datatype are distinguished by inserting a field in the json object called `"_type"` whose value is the name of the variant. As can be seen from the example bellow:
```scala
object CommonsJson extends App {
  import busymachines.json.syntax._
  import melonsDefaultSemiAutoCodecs._

  val winterMelon = WinterMelon(fuzzy = true, weight = 45)
  val waterMelon = WaterMelon(seeds = true, weight = 90)
  val smallMelon = SmallMelon
  val squareMelon = SquareMelon(weight = 10, tastes = Seq(SourTaste, SweetTaste))
  val melons = List[Melon](winterMelon, waterMelon, smallMelon, squareMelon)

  val rawJson = melons.asJson.spaces2
  println(rawJson)
  rawJson.unsafeDecodeAs[List[Melon]]
}
```
The printout. Notice that the tastes array contains simple strings, but the `SmallMelon`, even though it was a case object is still represented as a json object.
```json
[
  {
    "fuzzy" : true,
    "weight" : 45,
    "_type" : "WinterMelon"
  },
  {
    "seeds" : true,
    "weight" : 90,
    "_type" : "WaterMelon"
  },
  {
    "_type" : "SmallMelon"
  },
  {
    "weight" : 10,
    "tastes" : [
      "SourTaste",
      "SweetTaste"
    ],
    "_type" : "SquareMelon"
  }
]
```

### auto derivation of hierarchies

It should be clear by now what we have to do. Essentially nothing, but if we want to maintain the same behavior when converting `Taste` case objects, then we do have to explicitely create a codec for it. Otherwise it would represent this enumeration as json objects with only the `_type` field in them.

So, our code in this case looks like the following—and the result is the same:
```scala
object CommonsJson extends App {

  import busymachines.json._
  import busymachines.json.syntax._
  import busymachines.json.auto._

  //note that we did not import everything from the semiauto package, and there's a
  //good reason why, check out the next section.
  implicit val tasteEncoder: Codec[Taste] = semiauto.deriveEnumerationCodec[Taste]

  val winterMelon = WinterMelon(fuzzy = true, weight = 45)
  val waterMelon = WaterMelon(seeds = true, weight = 90)
  val smallMelon = SmallMelon
  val squareMelon = SquareMelon(weight = 10, tastes = Seq(SourTaste, SweetTaste))
  val melons = List[Melon](winterMelon, waterMelon, smallMelon, squareMelon)

  val rawJson = melons.asJson.spaces2
  println(rawJson)
  rawJson.unsafeDecodeAs[List[Melon]]
}
```

### combining auto, and semiauto derivation

Unfortunately there is a small caveat when combining these two methods of deriving json codecs. And we have to delve a bit into the internals of this library. The reason is that an implicit `Configuration` is required to derive all sealed traits, and we use the non-default way of adding in `_type` discriminator. This configuration can be found in `busymachines.json.DefaultTypeDiscriminatorConfig` and is mixed into both `auto` and `semiauto`.
```scala
trait DefaultTypeDiscriminatorConfig {

  private[this] final val JsonTypeString: String = "_type"

  final implicit val defaultDerivationConfiguration: io.circe.generic.extras.Configuration =
    io.circe.generic.extras.Configuration.default
      .withDiscriminator(JsonTypeString)

}
```
Therefore, if you do a wildcard import of both, you have two conflicting implicits—that are needed to derive _other_ implicits, that's why your compilation fails with `"Could not find implicit Encoder[A]"` instead of `"Conflicting Configuration implicit.`. Therefore, the recommended pattern of combining the two modes is to wildcard import `auto._`, and refer to `semiauto` by name—the latter having explicit methods like in the example in the previous section: `auto derivation of hierarchies`.
