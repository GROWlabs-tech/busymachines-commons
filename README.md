# busymachines-commons

Light-weight, modular, libraries for varying technology stacks, built _primarily_ on top of the [typelevel.scala](https://github.com/typelevel) ecosystem.

## Quickstart

## Library Structure

The idea behind these sets of libraries is to help jumpstart backend RESTful api application servers with varying technology stacks. That's why you will have to pick and choose the modules suited for your specific stack.

## Developer's Guide

## History

This used to be the resting place of the `busymachines-commons` library that we used internally for various projects, it reached version `0.6.5`, but it fell into disrepair. If you require that library, by any chance, then check-out the `zz_deprecated/release-0.6.5` branch, and good luck from there. That bit will never be maintained again.
