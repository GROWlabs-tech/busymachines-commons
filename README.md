# busymachines-commons

Light-weight, modular, libraries for varying technology stacks, built _primarily_ on top of the [typelevel.scala](https://github.com/typelevel) ecosystem.

## Quickstart

#### versions
- stable: `0.1.0`
- milestone: `0.2.0-M3`
- snapshot: `0.2.0-SNAPSHOT`

These modules are are cross-compiled for Scala versions: `2.12.3` and `2.11.11`. We try our best to keep them up to date.

Modules:
* `"com.busymachines" %% "busymachines-commons-core" % "0.1.0"` or `"0.2.0-M3"` [README.md](/core)
* `"com.busymachines" %% "busymachines-commons-json" % "0.2.0-M3"` [README.md](/json)
* `"com.busymachines" %% "busymachines-commons-rest" % "0.2.0-M3"` [README.md](/rest)
* `"com.busymachines" %% "busymachines-commons-rest-testkit" % "0.2.0-M3" % Test` [README.md](/rest-testkit)

## Library Structure

The idea behind these sets of libraries is to help jumpstart backend RESTful api application servers with varying technology stacks. That's why you will have to pick and choose the modules suited for your specific stack.

Basically, as long as modules reside in the same repository they will be versioned with the same number, and released at the same time to avoid confusion. The moment we realize that a module has to take a life of its own, it will be moved to a separate module and versioned independently.

* [core](/core) `0.1.0`
* [json](/json) `0.2.0-M3`
* [rest](/rest) `0.2.0-M3`
* [rest-testkit](/rest-testkit) `0.2.0-M3` - contains helpers that allow testing. Should never wind up in production code.

### Current version

The latest stable version is `0.1.0`. Modules are guaranteed to be compatible if they share the same version number, otherwise you are taking a serious gamble, and managing modules in any other way is not on the roadmap yet. Up until version `1.0.0` you can expect relatively unstable modules, so use with care.

## Developer's Guide

If you are responsible for publishing this library then you _have_ to follow instructions listed in [z-publishing-artifacts/README.md](z-publishing-artifacts/README.md), otherwise you can simply ignore that folder.

Have throw-away code? Just create a package `playground` anywhere, it is already in `.gitignore` specifically for this purpose. Just make sure it doesn't end up in production/test code :)

### build structure
The build is fairly straightforward. The root folder contains a phantom build from which all modules are configured, and an essentially empty project "busymachines-commons" that is never published, but one that is extremely useful for importing into your IDEs. Most top level folders `X` correspond to the specific `busymachines-commons-X` library. All dependencies are spelled out in the `./build.sbt` file

### History

This used to be the resting place of the `busymachines-commons` library that we used internally for various projects, it reached version `0.6.5`, but it fell into disrepair. If you require that library, by any chance, then check-out the `zz_deprecated/release-0.6.5` branch, and good luck from there. That bit will never be maintained again. And what you find resembles what was only by accident.
