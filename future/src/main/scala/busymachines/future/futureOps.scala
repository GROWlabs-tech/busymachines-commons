  /**
    *
    * Syntactically inspired from [[Future.traverse]], but it differs semantically
    * insofar as this method does not attempt to run any futures in parallel. "M" stands
    * for "monadic", as opposed to "applicative" which is the foundation for the formal definition
    * of "traverse" (even though in Scala it is by accident-ish)
    *
    * For the vast majority of cases you should prefer this method over [[Future.sequence]]
    * and [[Future.traverse]], since even small collections can easily wind up queuing so many
    * [[Future]]s that you blow your execution context.
    *
    * Usage:
    * {{{
    *   import busymachines.future._
    *   val patches: Seq[Patch] = //...
    *
    *   //this ensures that no two changes will be applied in parallel.

    *     Future {
    *       //apply patch
